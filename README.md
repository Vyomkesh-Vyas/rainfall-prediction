## 📌 Project Overview

The notebook performs the following tasks:

- 📥 Load rainfall dataset from CSV
- 📊 Explore and visualize rainfall patterns
- 🧹 Preprocess and split data into training and test sets
- 🧠 Train linear model using `scikit-learn`
- 🔮 Predict rainfall and evaluate model performance
